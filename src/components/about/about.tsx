          Mantine is an amazing library with a wide range of components, extensive customization options, and a vibrant
          community. It offers a developer experience unmatched by many React libraries.  However, its default styling can feel 
          less modern compared to frameworks like shadcn and Radix, which many companies prefer.
           Setting up colors and styles to match those modern aesthetics can be time-consuming and may hinder projects that need a quick start.

          That's where Mantine Theme Builder comes in. This tool provides pre-configured themes inspired by shadcn,
          allowing you to easily integrate modern styling into your Mantine project. Simply copy and paste the theme
          configuration, and you're good to go. In the future, we plan to add more sought-after themes, including the
          popular glasmorphic theme from Radix.
